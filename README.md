2. **Re-download the sheet** as a `.csv` file.
3. **Save and rename the file** as `question_data.csv`.

5. **Restart the app** to see the updated content:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 🌳 Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the directory structure:

```plaintext
src/
├── data/             # Contains the CSV and JSON data files
├── chakra/           # ChakraUI theme and custom styles
├── App.jsx           # Main React app entry point
```

### 🤖 Behind the Scenes

#### 🐍 Python Script

A Python script processes the `.csv` file into a `.json` file for React to consume. The script runs as part of the `npm run dev` workflow, so you don't have to worry about it.

- **Vite.js**: Lightning-fast dev environment.
- **React**: For building interactive components.
- **ChakraUI**: Stylish and accessible design system.
